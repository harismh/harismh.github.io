      <description>I know programming, but none of my family or friends understand it. Yet, I still make a sincere effort to explain my work. Some common questions I get from them are:
 What does all this text do? What&amp;rsquo;s with all the colors? Is this hacking/cracking? What exactly are cookies?  None of these are informed questions but I enjoy answering them nonetheless. They may seem like a waste of time for someone with expertise, but you can still learn a lot from these basic questions.</description>

      <description>Almost everyone claims to have the course or curriculum for learning code, be it giant colleges or small startups. However, I believe programming is one those skills that cannot be truly learned from lecturing or reading. It is a practical skill, much like playing an instrument or delivering a speech, that needs practical action. It is easy to teach the theory (and with programming, that is still a must), but making the transition from idealized textbooks to real-world problems demands real exposure.</description>
