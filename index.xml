      <description>I know programming, but none of my family or friends understand it. Yet, I still make a sincere effort to explain my work. Some common questions I get from them are:
 What does all this text do? What&amp;rsquo;s with all the colors? Is this hacking/cracking? What exactly are cookies?  None of these are informed questions but I enjoy answering them nonetheless. They may seem like a waste of time for someone with expertise, but you can still learn a lot from these basic questions.</description>

      <title>Learning How to Program (and Plenty of Other Skills)</title>

      <description>Almost everyone claims to have the course or curriculum for learning code, be it giant colleges or small startups. However, I believe programming is one those skills that cannot be truly learned from lecturing or reading. It is a practical skill, much like playing an instrument or delivering a speech, that needs practical action. It is easy to teach the theory (and with programming, that is still a must), but making the transition from idealized textbooks to real-world problems demands real exposure.</description>

      <description>Welcome. This is my personal website and its initial setup right now. GitHub is serving as host, Hugo is the blogging engine, and the theme is this one heavily modified. Although there&amp;rsquo;s plenty to fix and finish, a start&amp;rsquo;s a start.
Hugo definitely presents a far steeper learning curve than Jekyll, and its benefits are not apparent yet. But, giving any tech a proper run-through is important, and I consider a proper run-through as getting to a production MVP.</description>
